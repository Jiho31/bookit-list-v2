### Known issues (to be fixed)
1. For OAuth login, there is an account duplication issue.
 > When user is registered for Github using a Google account, and attempts to login using Google and Github like they're two different accounts, there will be an error.
2. Slow book cover image load time

> Book cover image loading takes long occasionally, especially when there's slow internet connection. For better user experience, this loading process can be improved (or fixed to look faster).
3. Data is unsynchronized when application is used within multiple browser tabs at the same time.
